Audio Web Visualizer is a software project that allows users to visualize their audio files in a unique and interactive way. Users can input their own audio files or choose from a database of audio files. The visualizer utilizes the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack and the javascript library p5.js.


Use Case: Song visualization
1. User logs into their account
2. User uploads a song into their library
3. User selects a visualizer design pattern
4. (Optional) User changes colors of design pattern
5. User downloads visual along with audio
